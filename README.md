## NEWS

### Version 2.0.0
** BREAKING CHANGES **  
The Gem has been updated to 2.0.0
It has been renamed from leetchi-api-ruby-sdk to mangopay.

Please make sure you update all the internal calls from Leetchi to MangoPay.

## Requirements

This gem uses mainly ruby stdlib and the *json* gem.

## Configuration

Please note that the gem configuration process change between 0.0.1 and 1.0.0.

### Version 0.0.1

Setup the following ENV:

```
ENV['LEETCHI_API_BASE_URL'] = "https://api-preprod.leetchi.com" # once you've run your test using the preproduction environment use the production one
ENV['LEETCHI_KEY_PATH'] = "abcd"                                # the full path to your leetchi key
ENV['LEETCHI_PASSPHRASE'] = "efgh"                              # you key's passphrase (leave blank if none)
ENV['LEETCHI_PARTNER_ID'] = "myID"                              # your MangoPay API ID
```

### Version 1.0.0

You can now call the MangoPay.configure method like this:

```ruby
MangoPay.configure do |c|
    c.preproduction = true
    c.partner_id = 'example'
    c.key_path = './spec/support-files/example.pem'
    c.key_password = ''
end
```

The **preproduction** attribute let you specify if you want to use the preproduction api endpoint.

The **partner_id** is the id that was issue to you during you registration process.

The **key_path** and **key_password** arguments are here to let you use the key you've created before the registration process.

This configure method can of course be use to define a Ruby on Rails initialiser.

## Usage

The gem implements the following resources:
- Beneficiary
- Card
- Contribution
- Expense
- Operation
- Immediate Contribution
- Recurrent Contribution (only available in preproduction)
- Strong Authentication
- Transfer
- User
- Wallet
- Withdrawal

Each resource has specifics methods such has `create`, `details`, `update`, etc. Those methods must be called with an ID and / or an Object matching the MangoPay API.
Calling those methods return the MangoPay API response has an object. Every executions are made synchronously.

### Example

This example creates a user and returns its informations:

```ruby
MangoPay::User.create({
    'Tag' => 'test',
    'Email' => 'my@email.com',
    'FistName' => 'Jack',
    'LastName' => 'Nelson',
    'CanRegisterMeanOfPayment' => true
})
```

This example returns a specific user's data:

```ruby
MangoPay::User.details(123)
```

### Tests
Make sure that you have run: ```bundle install```
Then you just have to run the rake task ```rake test``` to run all the test suite.

3. Add a test for your change. Only refactoring and documentation changes
require no new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need
a test!

4. Make the test pass.

5. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.

At this point you're waiting on us. We like to at least comment on, if not
